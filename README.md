It is a simplification of a biology/chemistry problem:
A string (e.g., representing a protein) composed of N consecutive elements at a
fixed unitary distance lays on a 2D (cartesian) plane.
At the beginning, the string forms a straight line and the goal is to fold the
string so that it forms some specified shape.
At each step, the shape of the string can be changed by selecting an internal
node of the string and rotating (bending) the string by 90 degrees clockwise or
counterclockwise, but after each rotation no two nodes can occupy the same point
on the 2D plane.

An example where the leftmost configuration is the initial state and the
rightmost one is the goal:
